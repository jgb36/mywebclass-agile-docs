# Initiative 2: Use agile project management tools to track progress and communicate project status updates
## Description:
The initiative is to implement agile project management tools to track progress and communicate project status updates.\

## Goals:
1. To improve project management efficiency
2. To increase transparency in project status updates
3. To improve collaboration and communication within the project team
4. To enhance the ability to adapt to changes in project scope or requirements

## Scope: 
The initiative will focus on selecting and implementing agile project management tools that align with the organization's 
needs and processes. Training will also be provided to team members on how to effectively use the tools.

## Outcomes:
1. Improved project management efficiency
2. Increased transparency in project status updates
3. Improved collaboration and communication within the project team
4. Enhanced ability to adapt to changes in project scope or requirements

## Deliverables:
1. Evaluation and selection of appropriate agile project management tools
2. Implementation of selected tools
3. Training materials and sessions for team members

## Milestones:
1. Selection of agile project management tools (Week 1)
2. Implementation of tools (Weeks 2-4)
3. Training sessions for team members (Weeks 4-6)
4. Rollout and adoption of tools (Week 6)

## Constraints:
1. Budget limitations for the purchase and implementation of the tools
2. Limited time for training and adoption of the tools

## Assumptions:
1. Team members have basic knowledge of agile project management principles
2. The selected tools will be compatible with existing technology infrastructure
3. Team members will be receptive to the change in project management processes

## Risks:
1. Resistance to change from team members
2. Incompatibility with existing technology infrastructure
3. Ineffective training resulting in low adoption of the tools

## Dependencies:
1. Availability of the selected agile project management tools
2. Cooperation and participation of team members in training and adoption of the tools

## Team:
1. Project Manager: responsible for overseeing the initiative and ensuring its success
2. IT Specialist: responsible for selecting and implementing the agile project management tools
3. Training Specialist: responsible for developing and conducting training sessions for team members

## Epics

## Test Plan
How will these be tested?\
This initiative can be tested through observation and comparison of previous management methods. Observations can be made 
during the implementation phase to see how effectively team members are using the tools and how they are impacting the project's progress and status updates. 
Moreover, the effectiveness of the initiative can be compared with previous project management methods used by the organization. 
This can be done by analyzing project completion times, productivity, and team satisfaction before and after the implementation of the agile project management tools.
