2. Increase efficiency in document sharing and editing
3. Facilitate remote work and collaboration
4. Improve transparency and accountability among team members

## Scope: 
The virtual team space will be created using a cloud-based platform that allows team members to collaborate in real-time. 
It will include features such as messaging, document sharing and editing, video conferencing, and task management.

## Outcomes:
1. Improved communication and collaboration among team members
2. Increased efficiency in document sharing and editing
3. Improved team productivity
4. Enhanced transparency and accountability among team members

## Deliverables:

2. User guide and training materials for team members
3. Regular maintenance and updates to ensure the platform runs smoothly

## Milestones:
1. Platform selection and procurement - 2 weeks
2. Platform setup and configuration - 2 weeks
3. User acceptance testing - 1 week
4. User training - 1 week
5. Launch and adoption - ongoing

## Constraints:
1. Budget limitations
2. Technical limitations of the platform 

## Assumptions:
1. Team members have access to a stable internet connection
2. Team members have access to suitable devices (laptops or desktop computers)
3. Team members are willing and able to use the virtual team space platform

## Risks:
1. Resistance to change from team members
2. Technical issues with the platform
3. Inadequate user training

## Dependencies:

## Test Plan
How will these be tested?\
To test the effectiveness of the virtual team space for collaboration, document sharing, and real-time communication, a user acceptance testing can be conducted.
This involves inviting a group of users (team members) to test the virtual team space platform to ensure that it meets 
their needs and expectations. The users will be asked to perform various tasks, such as sharing documents, messaging, 
and video conferencing, while the project team observes and records any issues or challenges encountered.
