Task Title: Create a sitemap to visualize website structure

User Story: As a website developer, I want to set up a basic website structure, including pages, navigation and footer, 
so that the website is easy to navigate and provides a good user experience.

Description: Develop a visual representation of the website structure using a sitemap. The sitemap will help identify the main pages and their hierarchy, 
and ensure a logical flow of information for the users. This will include things such as the home page,
about us, services, and contact information.

Effort Estimate: 2 days

Assigned to: Web Developer

Priority: High

Notes: The sitemap should include all the main pages of the website, such as home page, about us, services, products, and contact. 
It should be developed based on the user research findings to ensure it meets the target audience's needs and expectations. 
The sitemap will serve as a guide for the website development team throughout the project.
